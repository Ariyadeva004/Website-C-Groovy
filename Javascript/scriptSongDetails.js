    title: "7 Years",
    artist: "Lukas Graham",
    desc: "A reflective and soulful pop song that chronicles the journey of life from childhood to adulthood.",
    lyrics: `Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
    "Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
    Once, I was seven years old

    It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
    Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
    By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
    Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

    Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
    "Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"
    Once, I was eleven years old

    I always had that dream like my daddy before me
    So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
    Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
    'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

    Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
    Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
    Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

    I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
    'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
    I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
    And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

    Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
    I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
    Once, I was twenty years old

    Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
    We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
    Soon, we'll be thirty years old

    I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
    So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
    Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
    And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

    Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
    Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
    I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
    I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

    Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
    Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
    Soon, I'll be sixty years old
    Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
    Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
    Soon, I'll be sixty years old

    Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
    "Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
    Once, I was seven years old
    Once, I was seven years old`,

    title: "Be Alright",
    artist: "Dean Lewis",
    desc: "A heartfelt ballad about heartbreak and healing, blending personal experiences with stories from friends to convey a message of hope and resilience.",
    lyrics: `I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
    You look away from me and I see there's something you're trying to hide
    And I reach for your hand, but it's cold, you pull away again
    And I wonder what's on your mind

    And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
    You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
    You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
    They were my mate's and I feel the colour draining from my face

    And my friend said
    "I know you love her, but it's over, mate
    It doesn't matter, put the phone away
    It's never easy to walk away, let her go
    It'll be alright"

    So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
    And I know it wasn't right, but it was messing with my head
    And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
    And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on

    But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
    It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
    And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
    But I just wanna stay

    And my friend said
    "I know you love her, but it's over, mate
    It doesn't matter, put the phone away
    It's never easy to walk away, let her go
    It'll be okay

    It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
    So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
    You'll find another and you'll be just fine
    Let her go"

    But nothing heals the past like time
    And they can't steal
    The love you're born to find
    But nothing heals the past like time
    And they can't steal
    The love you're born to find

    "I know you love her, but it's over, mate
    It doesn't matter, put the phone away
    It's never easy to walk away, let her go
    It'll be okay

    It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
    So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
    You'll find another and you'll be just fine, let her go
    It'll be alright"

    It'll be alright
    It'll be alright
    It'll be alright
    It'll be alright`,

    title: "How Do I Say Goodbye",
    artist: "Dean Lewis",
    desc: "A touching tribute to Dean Lewis’s father, this emotional ballad explores the pain of impending loss and the struggle to say farewell with love and gratitude.",
    lyrics: `Early morning there's a message on my phone
    It's my mother saying, "Darling, please come home"
    I fear the worst, but how could you leave us all behind?
    There's so much to say but there's so little time

    So how do I say goodbye
    To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
    You gave me my name and the color of your eyes
    I see your face when I look at mine
    So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

    When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
    Right or wrong, you were always on my side
    But I'm scared of what life without you's like
    And I saw the way she looked into your eyes
    And I promise if you go, I will make sure she's alright

    So how do I say goodbye
    To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
    You gave me my name and the color of your eyes
    I see your face when I look at mine
    So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

    And there's no way you could ever let me down
    Gonna steal some time and start again
    You'll always be my closest friend
    And someday we are gonna make it out
    Just hold the light, just hold the light

    So how do I say goodbye
    To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
    You gave me my name and the color of your eyes
    I see your face when I look at mine
    So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
    So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?`,

    title: "Hate That It's True",
    artist: "Dean Lewis",
    desc: "A heartfelt track that captures the lingering pain and denial following a breakup, blending emotional lyrics with soaring melodies to convey the struggle of letting go.",
    lyrics: `I'm still wrapped up in your skin and bones
    Yeah, you feel like home
    It's funny how your fire burns, but I'm still cold
    How the hell you so cold?

    'Cause I can't let go, I can't give you up
    'Cause every time I do, I feel you in my guts

    'Cause I'm still in love
    With every single part of you
    Even that part of you
    That ripped out my heart
    In a way that no one else could do
    But I'm glad it was you, woah
    I drink with all my friends
    They say it's for the best
    It's only fucking with my head
    'Cause I'm still in love
    In love, love, love with you
    Oh, I hate that it's true
    I'm still in love with you

    There's no drug to get you off my mind
    And I'vе tried every kind
    So takе me back to when we'd stay up all night
    Drinking our favourite wine 

    'Cause I can't let go, I can't give you up
    'Cause every time I do, I feel you in my blood

    'Cause I'm still in love
    With every single part of you
    Even that part of you
    That ripped out my heart
    In a way that no one else could do
    But I'm glad it was you, and, oh
    I drink with all my friends
    They say it's for the best
    It's only fucking with my head
    'Cause I'm still in love
    In love, love, love with you
    Oh, I hate that it's true
    I'm still in love with you

    Oh
    (Oh, oh, oh) Oh, I hate that it's true
    (Oh, oh, oh)

    'Cause I'm still in love
    In love, love, love with you
    Oh, I hate that it's true
    I'm still in love with you`,
